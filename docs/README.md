# DéMars-DMC

Welcome to the DéMars-DMC documentation! The introduction below provides
an overview to help you navigate to your area of interest.

## Introduction

DéMars is Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain which uses XOR segments to
reduce the storage and network transfer costs, thereby enabling it to execute
on mobile nodes.

DéMars decouples the application logic from the state machine or consensus
mechanism, which makes it easier to develop various types of applications
which use the same BFT mechanism for validation. DéMars comes packaged with its
own coin application (which uses the native currency DMC). Follow the
[installation instructions](./install) to get up and running
quickly. For more details on [using DéMars](./using-demars) see that
and the following sections.

## Networks

Testnets can be setup manually on one or more machines, or automatically on one
or more machine, using a variety of methods described in the [deploy testnets
section](./deploy-testnets). For more information (and to join) about the
Cosmos Network testnets, see [here](/getting-started/full-node.md).

<!--
## Application Development

The first step to building application on DéMars is to [install
ABCI-CLI](./getting-started) and play with the example applications.
